static files are served by the production store (S3) so there is no need to change the main.js to use
the S3 static url or feed.js to use getstream zakanda production keys. All static files including those
are pulled from the production store so they already have these values. Have in mind that if the google analytics
are used in production, they will also be used here.

Have in mind that any changes you make to getstream related data (for example followers) will affect the
production zakanda getstream.

there is no https in this environment so in production settings you must deactivate these
SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
which means that it is not an exact production copy
